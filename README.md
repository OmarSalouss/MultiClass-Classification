# MultiClass-Classification
Multiclass classification is a type of machine learning task where data is classified into more than two distinct categories or classes. It's used to assign data points to one of several possible labels or categories, making it suitable for tasks like image recognition, language translation, and document categorization.

I have created a Java code with a user interface that tackles multiclass classification problems. This code allows users to classify data into a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 categories.
